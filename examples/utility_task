# EXAMPLE: utility tasks
#
# DESCRIPTION
# Taskopen can be used to execute arbitrary commands that exist as annotations to taskwarrior tasks.
# A utility task is one that carries a "payload" of one or more commands, and is intended for a specific function
# (this is an alternative approach to ../examples/templates)

# SETUP

# Add a new task
# task add backup files due:eow
# Created task 102
#
# task 102 annotate -- backup_home_directory: ~/bin/mybackup_app -f home
# task 102 annot -- backup_etc_directory: /usr/bin/unison -opts /etc
# task 102 ann -- backup_var_directory: /usr/bin/rsync -opts /var
#
# then, when you want to back up your files, run taskopen
#
# $ taskopen backup -x
#
# choose the desired actions(s) from the list and voila!
# (just don't use the made-up commands used as examples)
